# Introduction
This sample is a custom header that provides an interactive branded experience for SAP Jam Collaboration. It uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, custom Javascript libraries, and a stock-ticker gadget to accomplish this. The stock-ticker gadget also uses a third-party library that gets stock-ticker data from a third-party service (Alpha Vantage - https://www.alphavantage.co).

Use of the Alpha Vantage library and service is subject to applicable terms and conditions set out by Alpha Vantage. SAP does not make any representations or warranties respecting the Alpha Vantage library and service and SAP is not liable to you or any third party in respect of any use of the Alpha Vantage library and service.

To use this sample simply:
